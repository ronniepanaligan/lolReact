This repository is meant to help me improve my fullstack React skills with the help of the Riot LoL API.

##### Getting Started
Crated a main.js file in config and change the values for:
1. secret
2. API Key

Riot's API key expires in 2 days so you will constantly need to update it.

Main Features:
1. Summoners match history
2. Current game data
3. Summoners match history with current champ
